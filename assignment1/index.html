      <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
      <p><span class="clickable" id="part-one">from inside the cave...</span></p>
      
      <p>If you were to never leave your cave and only perceive the world through the shadows that appear on the wall in front of you, you might assume that this shadow is some sort of flat animal with a head, body, legs, and a tail. Many things are unclear about this animal as the cave people only have the shadow to go off of, one example is they cannot determine what color this animal is, which may help them narrow down what animal with a tail this is. When the <span class="clickable" id="first-change">first change</span> occurs, people living in the cave might say they see the animal running east and west, or forward and backward. The animal never goes away though, instead of it running right off the cave view it goes back the other way. After the <span class="clickable" id="second-change"> Second change</span>, the cave dwellers might guess that the mystery animal is jumping up and down. Or maybe they do not know what jumping is so the cave people believe that the animal is flying or hovering, moving more north and then more south as there is also no defined ground for the animal to bounce off of, and it goes lower then where the animal's original stationary position was.</p>

      <p>I believe that the point that Nick Sousanis wanted to get across about flatness is to only see things in a simple, one sided view. To not question things or seek out what more might be out there, but to take things at face value. The problem with this is that things are more complicated then that, there are always three sides to every story, your side, their side, and the truth. If you only listen to your side of the story and their side of the story you miss out on the true story. Just like the three sides of every story, there are three dimensions to every object, width, height and depth. When you only view the width and height you miss out on the true depth of the object. The people in the cave only allow themselves to see the width and height of the objects in the shadows, they miss out on the truth of objects, that the object is not all in one piece and that the object actually has depth to it. The people in the cave are depriving themselves of third dimension because they do not want to complicate their easy and simple lives of believing the shadow puppets shown to them.</p>

      <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
      <p><span class="clickable" id="part-two">from outside the cave...</span></p>
      
      <p>When we finally step outside of the cave we see the "animal" for what it truly is, a bunch of three dimensional, multi-colored objects, not even all attached to each other. The mystery animal was not an animal at all, just simply an illusion using a light source and precisely placed cubes, spheres, capsules, and tubes. You can image the confusion on the cave dwellers face's when they finally look at the things they thought was one coherent animal. After the <span class="clickable" id="third-change">third change</span> the people outside the cave can clearly see the left leg, now seen to be only a long cube, rotating on its z-axis, the longer parts of the cube come closer, rotating forward and backward in a swinging type motion. For the <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change"> fourth change</span>, the sphere, which would make up the "head" of the animal slowly moves closer to the person outside of the cave until it eventually disappears behind them. The sphere will then eventually pass the light source, possibly the sun someone who just stepped out of a cave might think. The circular shadow on the cave wall then begins move downward until it eventually shrinks and disappears. 
      </p>

      <p>Nick Sousanis wants the reader of his book to understand the concept of seeing double as understanding more of something the more angles you look at it from, but also that looking at something from many angles does not always add up to the truth. Above I mentioned that there are three sides to every story, what happens if you add more? What if you get the story angle from the man squinting his eyes from across the street to view what happened, or from the person who kinda remembers it going like this but not entirely sure? Those are more sides of the story so it should clarify things even more, but you would be wrong, those sources have completely different recounts of the story. More angles do not equal the truth, and who is to say what the truth really is because everyone thinks that their story is the truth. The people in the cave might view the third change as the mystery animal's leg shorting then returning to full length then to shorten completely to where it disappears then comes back. Maybe the animal is doing a funny marching routine that involves a little stomp and then raising it's leg completely. If the cave people were to view the fourth change they would be horrified as they probably think that the animal's head is falling off, until it just disappears.
